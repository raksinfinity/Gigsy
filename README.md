Gigsy - Creators And Champions Related Analytics - 2020 
The Gigsy website welcomes tens of thousands of people from around the world to create, and earn a living. The following graph visualization shows all creators enrolled in the 2020. Additionally the visualizations dig deeper and show how many champions(subscribers) are present based on bronze, silver, gold tier models. 

The clusters are divided based on the base_type like artist, musician etc for which I have added a category_code.
Files:
new.html - basic html file containing links to other scripts, div is defined here.
immigration.js - contains all function for collecting data and creating visualizations.
